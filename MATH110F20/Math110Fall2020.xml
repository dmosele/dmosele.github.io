                    <solution>
                        <p>We would say that <m>H</m> a function of <m>t</m> because the temperature depends on the day.

                        <p>The mathematical statement <m>f(4)=42</m> indicates that at age 4 years, the child is 42 inches tall.</p>

                                    Comparing to part (a) we see that we get a larger result and hence the average number of subscriptions looks to be increasing faster in the second time interval.

                <p>In track running, there are several races that are approximately a mile. In high school track the distance often used is 1600 meters, as it is four times around the standard track when running in the innermost lane. Historically, the mile (which is approximately 1609.344 meters) has been significant in running with Roger Bannister breaking the four minute barrier in 1954. However, in the modern Olympics, the distance most commonly run that is close to a mile is the 1500 meters.</p>

                    <p>This race has been run in every summer Olympic games since 1896. The summer Olympics have been held every four years except in 1916, 1940, and 1944. Oddly, the Olympics were also held out of schedule in 1906, and the governing body of the Olympics doesn't recognize the medals received during these games.</p>

                <alert> Analyzing the Data </alert>

                    <p>The race has been an Olympic event for men longer than it has for women, so the data goes back further.  In this project you will be making predictions based on a linear regression formula for the winning times.  So first copy the men's and women's data into Excel or Desmos, taking care to convert all times into seconds.  Graph both sets of data on the same set of axes and add trend lines.  Have Excel/Desmos display both equations and the trend lines.</p>
                     
                     <p> Before using the trend lines, write the formulas for both using proper function notation.  Let <m>f</m> be the function for the men's times and <m>g</m> be the function for the women's times.  Completely explain what the input and output of each function is.  Also discuss how the R-values for each function affect your confidence in using them.  Excel will report R squared rather than R, so you will need to calculate R from it. Is R positive or negative?  Why?</p>
                     
                     <p> After discussing the formulas and their R-values, explain the meanings of the basic geometric properties of each trend line.    In particular, using the context of the problem, give the practical meaning of the slopes, vertical intercepts, and horizontal intercepts of each line.  Do all of your answers and explanations seem reasonable?  If not, why not? </p>
                     
                     <p> Following the discussion of the geometric properties, use the trend lines to answer all of the following questions.  When answering each question, use proper mathematics and function notation when presenting the necessary algebra to answer each question.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li> What are the meanings of <m>f(1980)</m> and <m>g(1980)</m>?  How reliable is each result? </li>

                    <li> You will notice there are some years missing in the data for the men when there normally would have been Olympics if the four year cycle was followed.  Why might these scores be missing?  Use your trend line to predict the winning times if these Olympics had been held.  How much do you trust these results? </li>

                    <li> In what year would have or will the winning times for the men and women be the same? </li>

                    <li> What times do you predict will be necessary to win the men's and women's in the 2020 Olympics? </li>

                    <li> Use your trend lines to approximate at which Olympics the men and women will break the 3 minute mark.  Do you believe your predictions? </li>
                </ol>

                <p><alert> Report Guidelines </alert></p>

                     <p>The final paper must be type written including all necessary formulas.  To type formulas in Word, use Insert/Equation.  This should be written as a paper and not a long homework problem.  In particular, do not number parts, instead write in sentences and paragraphs and use section headings if appropriate.  Each paper should include a title page, an introduction, a main body, and a conclusion.  As a general guide after reading the introduction, the reader should know what you are going to do, and why, without referring to this assignment sheet.  The main body should consist of answers to all of the questions, a discussion of each, and all the necessary formulas and algebra to find them.  Use your book as a guide on how to properly display equations.  Make sure you define every variable you use immediately before or after it first appears.  Also the Excel graph you created should be within the text (not at the end) and referred to by the text when you are initially explaining your functions.  The conclusion should summarize what you learned.  Specifically, what you learned about the winning times using your trend lines, not what you learned about mathematics (that is just hopefully a side effect).    Throughout adopt the tone that these are things you set out to find out on your own and are reporting your findings, not like you are responding to questions.  </p>

				<exercise>
					Find the equation of the exponential function passing through the points <m>(1,6)</m> and <m>(4,24)</m>.
					<solution>
						<p>As the function is of the form <m>y=a\cdot b^x</m>, we see that </p>
						<me> 24=ab^4 \text{ and } 6=ab^1 </me>
						<p>Dividing the two equations yields</p>
						<me> \frac{24=ab^4}{6=ab^1} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 4 = b^3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad b = \sqrt[3]{4} </me>
						<p> Now that we know <m>b</m>, we can find <m>a</m> by using one of the above equations</p>
						<me>6=a\sqrt[3]{4}^1 \Rightarrow a = \frac{6}{\sqrt[3]{4}} </me>
						<me> y=\frac{6}{\sqrt[3]{4}}(\sqrt[3]{4})^x</me>
						<p>(It would be a good idea to check by graphing).</p>

  					Suppose the population of ants in my yard is given by 
  					<me>A =f(t)= 100(1.12)^t </me>
  					where <m>A</m> represents the number of ants, and <m>t</m> is time in weeks since I started measuring.
  					<ol type="a">
   						<li>Is the number of ants increasing or decreasing? By what percentage is it increasing/decreasing each week?</li>
    						<li>When will the population of ants reach 1000?
						</li>
					</ol>
					<solution>
						<ol type="a">
							<li> It is increasing because the growth factor <m>1.12</m> is greater than 1. It increases by 12% per week</li>
							<li> <p>According to the graph, during week 20 the ant population reaches 1000.</p>

					Surprise! You receive a $5000 bonus from your new job! You are deciding how you should invest this. (You really want to buy a new motorcycle.) 
  					<ul>
    						<li>Option 1: A savings account that earns $12.1%$ compounded annually.</li>
    						<li>Option 2: A savings account that earns $12%$ compounded monthly.</li>
					</ul>

  					<ol type="a">
   						<li>Suppose that we invest in "Option 1". Write a formula for the balance of the account <m>A</m> after <m>t</m> years.</li>
    						<li>Suppose that we invest in "Option 2". Write a formula for the balance of the account <m>B</m> after <m>t</m> years.</li>
    						<li>What is the effective interest rate for "Option 2"? Which account would you invest in?</li>
    						<li><p>The motorcycle you want is $10000. How long will it take to save up that much using "Option 2"? </p>
						<p><interactive desmos="3ywothugrj" width="100%" aspect="3:2" /></p></li>
					</ol>
					<solution>
					<ol type="a">
   						<li><me>B_1 = 5000(1.121)^t</me></li>
    						<li><me>B_2 = 5000\left(1+\frac{.12}{12}\right)^{12t} = 5000(1.01)^{12t}</me></li>
    						<li><p>To compute the effective rate, we strip away the 5000 and plug in 1 for t to see the effect after 1 year.</p>
						<me> 1.01^{12} = 1.1268 </me>
						<p>This tells us that our effective rate is <m>12.68</m>%</p></li>
    						<li><p>We see that the graph of our "Option 2" function and the horizontal line at $10000 intersect when <m>t=5.805</m> meaning that it takes almost 6 years for us to reach the desired $10000 </p>

						<me> \log(\sqrt{1000}) = \log(1000^{\frac 12}) = \frac 12 \log(1000) = \frac 12 \cdot 3 = \frac 32</me></li>

  					<p>Using our logarithm properties, solve the equation</p>

						<p>The key to this one is taking the natural logarithm of both sides (a preview of the next section). </p>
						<me> \ln(e^{0.12x}) = \ln(100) \quad \Rightarrow \quad 0.12x = \ln(100) </me>

					If you invest $1200 in an account accrues interest at a rate of 5% compounded continuously, how long will it take for the balance to reach $1600?
					<solution>
						<p>The formula for the account balance is</p>
						<me>B = 1200e^{0.05t}</me>
						<p>We want to know when it reaches $1600, so we set <m>B</m> to 1600 and solve for <m>t</m>.</p>
						<me> 1600 = 1200 e^{0.05t} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{1600}{1200} = e^{0.05t} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \ln\left(\frac{1600}{1200}\right) = \ln(e^{0.05t})=0.05t </me>

					<ol type="a">
    						<li><p>We start with what we know, namely that 
						<m>P=11000b^t</m> as the initial quantity is 11000. We then use the fact that <m>P</m> is 13000 when <m>t=3</m> to see</p>
						<me>13000=11000b^3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{13000}{11000} = b^3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sqrt[3]{\frac{13000}{11000}} = b</me>
						<me> P = 11000\left( \sqrt[3]{\frac{13000}{11000}} \right)^t </me></li>

					<p>The technology company Orange started selling its oPhone in 2015 with sales of 10000 oPhones. By 2018 it sold 500000 oPhones. Model the growth of oPhone sales using an exponential function of the form</p>
   					<me>f(t)= ae^{kt} </me>
  					where <m>t</m> is time in years since 2015.
					<solution>
						<p>We start with the fact that we know <m> f(t)=10000e^{kt}</m> as the initial quantity was 10000. Then we use that when <m>t=3</m>, the number of phones is 500000.</p>
						<me>500000=10000e^{k\cdot 3} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 50 = e^{3k} </me>
						<me> \ln(50)=\ln(e^{3k})=3k \quad \Rightarrow \quad k = \frac{\ln(50)}{3} \approx 1.30401</me>
						<p> Putting it all together, we get</p>
						<me> f(t) = 10000e^{1.30401t}</me>
					</solution>

				<exercise>
  					Convert the exponential function <m>f(t)=3(0.5)^t</m> to a function of the form <m>f(t)=ae^{kt}</m>. What do you notice about <m>k</m> in this scenario?
					<solution>
						<p>Here, we remember that <m>b=e^k</m> and since <m>b=.5</m>, we can use that to solve for <m>k</m>. </p>
						<me>0.5=e^k \quad \Rightarrow \quad \ln(0.5)=\ln(e^k)=k </me>
						<p> Note that <m>\ln(0.5) \approx -0.6931</m> so </p>
						<me> f(t)=3e^{-0.6931t}</me>
						<p> The thing that is different in this scenario is that we have a negative <m>k</m> value. This happens when the exponential function is decreasing</p>
