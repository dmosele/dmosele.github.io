<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The final paper must be type written including all necessary formulas.  To type formulas in Word, use Insert/Equation.  This should be written as a paper and not a long homework problem.  In particular, do not number parts, instead write in sentences and paragraphs and use section headings if appropriate.  Each paper should include a title page, an introduction, a main body, and a conclusion.  As a general guide after reading the introduction, the reader should know what you are going to do, and why, without referring to this assignment sheet.  The main body should consist of answers to all of the questions, a discussion of each, and all the necessary formulas and algebra to find them.  Use your book as a guide on how to properly display equations.  Make sure you define every variable you use immediately before or after it first appears.  Also the Excel graph you created should be within the text (not at the end) and referred to by the text when you are initially explaining your functions.  The conclusion should summarize what you learned.  Specifically, what you learned about the winning times using your trend lines, not what you learned about mathematics (that is just hopefully a side effect).    Throughout adopt the tone that these are things you set out to find out on your own and are reporting your findings, not like you are responding to questions.</p>
