# # Basic Mathematical Operations in Python

# For the most part, mathematical operations work just like you would like in Python. For example, let's add 3 and 5 by typing "3+5". To execute code in a Jupyter Notebook cell, you press Shift+Enter.

# In[1]:


3+5


# Python then reports the answer correctly as 8.
# 
# The same is true for multiplication and division.

# In[2]:


3*5


# In[3]:


5/3


# If we want to exponentiate however, the typical caret symbol doesn't work. In fact, it has to do with the "exclusive or" logical operation.

# In[4]:


3^5


# Using two asterisks though yields the desired result.

# In[5]:


3**5
