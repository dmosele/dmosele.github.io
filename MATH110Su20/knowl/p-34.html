<p>In track running, there are several races that are approximately a mile. In high school track the distance often used is 1600 meters, as it is four times around the standard track when running in the innermost lane. Historically, the mile (which is approximately 1609.344 meters) has been significant in running with Roger Bannister breaking the four minute barrier in 1954. However, in the modern Olympics, the distance most commonly run that is close to a mile is the 1500 meters.</p>
