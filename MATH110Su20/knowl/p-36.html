<p>This race has been run in every summer Olympic games since 1896. The summer Olympics have been held every four years except in 1916, 1940, and 1944. Oddly, the Olympics were also held out of schedule in 1906, and the governing body of the Olympics doesn't recognize the medals received during these games.</p>
